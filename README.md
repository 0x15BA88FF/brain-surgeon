# ðŸ§  brain-surgeon

**brain-surgeon** is a linter and formatter for the [Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck) programming language, written in modern C++.

It includes:

* ðŸ›  A **command-line linter/formatter** for Brainfuck code.
* ðŸ§© A **VS Code extension** for Brainfuck syntax highlighting, linting, and formatting.
* ðŸ§ª A simple **Brainfuck interpreter** written in C.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Brainfuck?

Brainfuckâ€™s simplicity makes it ideal for tooling like linters and formatters â€” and brain-surgeon brings modern code quality tools to this minimal esolang.
Also there doesn't exist any brainfuck linter and formatter (as far as i could find).

## âœ¨ Features

* **Linting**: Detects unnecessary commands, unmatched brackets, and style inconsistencies.
* **Formatting**: Cleans up and indents Brainfuck code for better readability.
* **VS Code Integration**:
  * Syntax highlighting
  * Real-time linting
  * On-save formatting
* **Simple Brainfuck Interpreter**: Minimal implementation in C for running `.bf` programs.

## ðŸ—‚ Project Structure

```bash
brain-surgeon/
â”œâ”€â”€ brain-surgeon/        # C++ linter/formatter (CLI tool)
â”œâ”€â”€ vscode-extension/     # VS Code extension (syntax + tooling support)
â””â”€â”€ bf-interpreter/       # C interpreter for Brainfuck
```

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### ðŸ”§ Build and Install CLI Linter/Formatter

```bash
cd brain-surgeon
make clean install
```

This will build the `brain-surgeon` binary and install it to your system (typically `/usr/local/bin/brain-surgeon`).

### ðŸ§ª Build and Install the Interpreter

```bash
cd bf-interpreter
make clean install
```

This builds and installs a lightweight Brainfuck interpreter called `bf-interpreter`.

---

## ðŸ§© VS Code Extension

To build and install the VS Code extension:

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run package
```

Then in VS Code:

1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
2. Run: `Extensions: Install from VSIX`
3. Select the generated `.vsix` file

---

## ðŸ“¦ CLI Usage

### Format or Lint Brainfuck Code

```bash
brain-surgeon [options] <file.bf>
```

**Options:**

* `lint`     â€” Lint the Brainfuck code
* `fmt`   â€” Format the code and output to stdout

---

## ðŸ§ª Interpreter Usage

Run a Brainfuck program:

```bash
bf program.bf
```

---

## ðŸ“¸ Example

**Input:**

```
+++[>+++[>+++<-]<-]>>.
```

**Formatted:**

```
+++
[
    > +++
    [
        > +++
        < -
    ]
    < -
]
>> .
```
